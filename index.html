      <h2>How My World Collapsed</h2>
      <p>It's no secret that looks play a major part in our lives. Well, everyone figures it out at some point in
        their lives, I did it at 15 years old. I always knew something is wrong with me, but before this moment, I was
        not so sure about WHAT exactly is wrong. Yes, I always disliked they way I look, but I thought maybe it's my
        social awkwardness caused by severe abuse and
        isolation that makes everybody hate me, but no. I had a friend exactly like me, but for some reason, other
        people liked him.</p>
      <p>It's ALL about looks and nothing else. What I failed to realize is that he has desirable traits such as blue
        eyes and tall femur, which made people approach him despite him being outright rude and disrespectful. The
        moment of realization is when my world collapsed, and I knew I would never recover from this.</p>

      <h2>The Downfall</h2>
      <p>This is where my downfall began, I subconsciously knew I'm doomed. I didn't want to do anything, I was
        chronically tired and sick. I had no courage to study or do anything with my worthless life, though I still had
        some hope that maybe things will get better in the future. I did not study for the national exam at all. Though
        I still got a higher score, I could've done better and secured free education at a decent university. </p>
      <p>Ever since I turned 18, things started getting much worse than I thought. I had no hope left, and I've almost
        given up on life.</p>

      <h2>It Gets Worse</h2>
      <p>It's fall 2023, I've planned to kill myself at my 20th birthday on March 24th, 2024. It's all settled, and I
        have no remorse in what I'm about to do. I've completely given up on my studies and even more so, my health.</p>
      <p>Of course I couldn't do it. I've realized I'm a pussy and backed away. I held a knife in my hand and all I
        could do is some scratches on my wrist, I didn't even lose blood. By that time, everything has crumbled. I've
        failed all my courses in a university, got fired from a job, gained a lot of weight (though it's
        all antidepressants' side effects). I hit the rock bottom, and I think I'm actually killing myself in 2025.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While my story is tragic, you can learn a lot from it. DO NOT OPEN YOUR EYES. Stay blind to sweet lies you're
        subconsciously
        telling yourself, your brain does it for a reason. Being exposed to harsh reality is too much to handle for most
        people, including myself. I could not deal with being ugly and killed myself, pretty sure it's not what you want
        in your life.</p>
      <p>I hate everything and everyone. I wish you the worst.</p>

        <h3>Important Note</h3>
        <p>Do not take antidepressants. They only make things worse, much worse.
